INSTALLING UBUNTU : (completed successfully)

One of my biggest fears was loosing my data while dual booting my lap with ubuntu. After watching a lot of youtube videos and reading many blogs again and again, I boosted my confidence to finally insall Ubuntu. 
I installed Ubuntu (20.04) from the official web and had to install some other important tools like Rufus (to format bootable USB drives) and SDcard formatter (to prepeare a drive and create bootable media). 
I hope so I didnt encounter any problems while dual booting Ubuntu :)
Now I am glad that my lap is dual booted with windows and ubuntu.
