DEBUGGING DERBIES: I really feel proud to have done this task sucessfully.To tell the truth one doesn't need to know java to complete this task. I had no idea about java during the early days.But fortunately I was taught Java in my branch(AIE) as a part of OOP.Doing the program in eclipse IDE will make your work even more easier.I found a very few syntax errors and many logic,typo errors.The comment lines by Lenna helped me a lot to overview the code. Thanks to Lenna :)
