INTROSPECTION

Why must we choose you?

I hope telling a little about me will answer this question.To accept the truth, I am a slow programmer. I didnot concentrate much in learning c++ during my school days and fortunately the cs board exam was cancelled.After the board exams,The question came in my life WHAT NEXT?. Well, I never had a dream in my life. The next few days of my life became so crucial for me.I started discovering my interests in computer science and Artificial intelligence engineering. From then I decided to learn new everyday about CS and AI.Since I was not strong in any programming languages, I took up a python 3 course in Codecademy that built my programming knowledge at its best!. I too started my Machine learning course from coursera. My motivations were at the peak and I started working hard everyday to build a better me.Infact the major reason of me joining Amrita school of engineering was the club AMFOSSS. I improved my coding skills, patience, coding speed,problem solving ability,concentration,creativity and what not. So coding had numerous benfits which you only get by meditating for hours :) So to conclude, I bet to never give up, Stay strong ,confident and patient to code for life and living.

What is your plan for the next 6 months?

I had always dreamed about working in google during my school days. Then I came to know about the GSOC.Hence I will start preparing from now to get into gsoc.I will also be strengthening my core knowledge in python and c++. If time permits I would also love to learn new languages like javascript for web development :)

How would you contribute back to the club? 

I am so passionate about teaching and explaining the concepts in my way. So I hope I can share my knowledge with my juniors of the club. I also wish to make my club and college proud by contributing a lot to Open source Softwares.

Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

I am very much satisfied about the selection process of the club :) I wish to make this an oppertunity to thank all my seniors from the club who helped me at times of difficulties during thetask completion.
