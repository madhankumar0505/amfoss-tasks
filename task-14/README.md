BANDIT:
 
I used cygwin IDE and compiler to command in linux.

Programming in linux was entirely new for me. After learning some basic linux commands from the net, I was able to complete first 3 levels in a go.Upcoming levels were a real challenge for me. Each level had its own difficulties. After a lot of effort and hardwork I was finally able to complete until level 11. That was a proud moment storing all bandit level entry passwords in a file ;)
